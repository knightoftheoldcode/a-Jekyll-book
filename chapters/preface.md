# Preface

You might have heard of the new trend "beta books" in which authors try to get some input from a given community to help shape the direction of said book. This is an "alpha book". One day, it aspires to grow up and become a beta book. And it certainly aspires to be a real book. Maybe find a mommy book and have baby books...but that is a diffent field of science.

As it stands, *please* offer feedback for this book. I want it to be as valuable as possible to the community as a whole.

The book is being developed on the [https://www.softcover.io/](https://www.softcover.io/) platform. I chose to honor the spirit of the founders and offer the book for free online (html version). There will also be paid (but inexpensive) formats available. My initial thought is to offer the ebook package (pdf, epub, mobi) for about $9.95, but tht is subject to change. The platform also makes it easy to offer rich media options such as screencasts for an additional fee. If there is enough interest I will certainly consider putting the time into producing these assets.
