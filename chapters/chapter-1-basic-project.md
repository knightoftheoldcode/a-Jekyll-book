# A Basic Project
\label{cha:chapter-1-basic-project}

Welcome to [A Jekyll Book: Web Development for Mad Scientists](http://linktojekyllbook/). Our purpose in this book is to begin the journey toward web devevelopment mastery. The journey of a thousand sites begins with a single commit. (Footnote: everone else has misqouted Lao-tzu, I'm going to as well. [http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24004.html](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24004.html))

We will begin this journey with our trusted blade: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a "static site generator", a new trend in web design that favors lightweight, pre-assembled websites over heavy, dynamic "content management systems".

If you are unfamiliar with any of these concepts, fear not. We will walk through the steps in detail. On our way to building (yet another) Jekyll template "alterego", we will learn basic web technologies, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, version control, and deployment. Experienced web developers will quicky introduce you to the world of static generation and help explore the power thousands of developers have been discovering over the course of the last few years.

A Jekyll Book takes a holistic approach to web development by building a real-world example website. Although *I* will be building the afrementioned "alterego" template, I encourage *you* to build what every aspiring 21st Century Web Developer needs: a personal brand portfolio site. (We will templatize the code beneath your website so that it is easy to fork as a starting point for additional sites you'll be itching to build. And since you'll no doubt be an expert after this book, we look forward to posting your success story--and pictures of you swimming in your coin vault--on our website.)

This first chapter will introduce you to the mind-like-water status with a quick demo of the default Jekyll template. In a matter of minutes, we'll create an initial personal blog template, place it under version control (git), and deploy it to the public (via GitHub).

In Chapter 2, we'll start from scratch, but implement a more sophisticated project instance. We will learn how to build a custom Cloud based development environment, capable of handling multiple versions of Jekyll's runtime simultaneously. We will learn an easy way to keep your envorinment sync'd with GitHub Pages.

The rest of the book will branch out and explore standard (and a few more obscure) features of modern websites. We will, of course, investigate how to utilize the strengths of Jekyll to assist in implementation details.
